## Setup Project Locally
To run the project locally. Run the following commands;
- Fork the repository or do `git clone <repository url>`

## Environment Setup
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies from the system-wide Python packages. To create a virtual environment, use the following commands:

```commandline
# On Windows
python -m venv venv

# On macOS and Linux
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```commandline
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS and Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install required dependencies
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
